        <h1>Swimming In the Wild</h1>
        <h3>Everything an adventurous soul like you needs to know about wild swimming.
            <br>What it is, how you can do it, health benefits & where to find out more
        </h3>
    </div>
    <br>

    <div class="wild">
        <h2>Why go ‘wild’ swimming</h2>
        <p>There is something slightly naughty, a little bit scary and wonderfully
            invigorating about leaving your wetsuit at home, and entering open water
            with just your skin (and perhaps a swimming costume) between you and the
            elements.Freed from the thermal and neoprene protection of a wetsuit,
            cold water immersion provides a sense of elation and relaxation, soothes
            muscle aches, relieves depression and boosts the immune system. It’s also a
            antastically convenient way to explore the countryside, with no kit to lug
            around. 
        </p>
        <p>The health and psychological benefits of dipping in natural waters
            have been long known. George Bernard Shaw, Benjamin Britten, Charles Darwin
            and Florence Nightingale were all advocates of regular cold baths to
            strengthen the mental constitution and physical state. And all wild-dippers
            know the natural endorphin high that raises mood, elates the senses and
            creates an addictive urge to dive back in, and sets the day off to a
            fantastic start.
        </p>
        <p>The vaso dilation in the extremities also pumps out toxin,
            and the cold water starts a process of cold adaptation, which quickly builds
            your cold tolerance, make cold water feel more comfortable, and your body more
            healthy.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="wild">
        <h2>Can anyone do it?</h2>
        <p>Open water swimming is for everyone of all abilities and age groups as long as you have the ability and
            confidence to swim without being able to put your feet down.</p>

        <p>Remember it’s very likely you’ll be out of your depth for some of the time (if not most of the time).</p>

        <p>You can take it as seriously or as casually as you want to, from social swimming to elite level. All we ask
            is that you try and enjoy what you do.</p>

        <h2>Health benefits of wild swimming</h2>
        <p>The health and psychological benefits of dipping in natural waters have long been known,
            as our many spa towns are testament to. Florence Nightingale and Charles Dicken both claimed
            to have been cured by these traditional forms of ‘hydrotherapy’.</p>

        <p>A powerful endorphin shot is released and this natural high bringing on intense feelings
            of well being and an addictive urge to dive back in. Third, after regular swimming, a process
            known as cold adaptation kicks in. Not only does this reduce your body’s sensation of coldness
            (making even the coldest water quite pleasant), it is clinically proven to boost mode, libido
            and the immune system – as shown in NASA experiments from the 1980s. Coldwater swimming is also a
            sure-fire way to burn calories quickly and building muscle tone and graceful technique.</p>

        <p>People also explain that wild swimming is a very good way to de-stress, and acts like a form of
            mindfulness or meditation, bringing them into the moment, focusing their mind on the physical
            sensations, and taking them away from their worries and concerns. In some ways it is the perfect digital
            detox.</p>
