                    <h3>Forty Foot</h3>
                    <p>The Forty Foot, a historic bathing pool at the southern tip of Dublin Bay,
                        has been named among the best places to swim in the world by the NYT.
                        Once a male only swimming spot, The Forty Foot near Dún Laoghaire in
                        South Dublin is now open to everyone young and old to swim there.
                        People have been swimming in the Irish Sea all year round for some
                        250 years.

                    <h3>Gormire Lake in Hambleton, North Yorkshire</h3>
                    <p> Gormire Lake - also known as the White Mere - was formed by
                        glacial erosion over 20,000 years ago, making it a remnant of the
                        last Ice Age, its one of only four natural lakes in Yorkshire.
                        Gormire roughly translates as 'filthy swamp', but that has not
                        stopped the lake becoming a go-to choice for plenty of wild swimmers.
                        The lake in North York Moors National Park has no inflow or major
                        outflow of water and is thought to be fed by an underground spring.

                        the meadow the flood plains are home to many species of cattle,
                        horses and wildfowl. Swim in the river Thames without all the
                        city grub - the water in Port Meadow is so clear it's hard to
                        believe that it is the same river as the murky trail that snakes
                        throught London. The grassy banks have natural bays, ideal for
                        sitting down with a picnic punctuated by repeated dips.
